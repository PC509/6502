# 6502

Repository for new 6502 faux console build. This has been a lifelong idea and goal, and it is very doable. This should be SG1000/Colecovision era of gaming. I am going to start this on a breadboard and eventually to a single PCB. 

Intended specs:

WD 65c02
WD 6522 VIA for 2 Atari style controllers (use Sega Master System controllers)
32K RAM
32K ROM (ish, after I/O, etc.)
TMS9918A (Video Display Processor) with SRAM mod and 16KB VRAM
Dual AY-3-8910 audio processors
Glue logic to support all IC's

Optional and going to attempt after initial build:

Small ROM segment for BIOS
Cart slot for ROM (similar to consoles)
3D printed case

Hopefully complete a few games

Pac-Man (port)
Space Invaders (port)
Donkey Kong (port)
Self designed game (original)
